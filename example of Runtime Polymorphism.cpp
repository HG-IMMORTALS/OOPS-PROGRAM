//example of runtime polymorphism


//Advantage of Runtime polymorphism is that it allows you to pass any object to a function.
//In example1, only base obj can be passed. This is disadvantage of compile time polymorphism
//In example2, any type of obj can be passed. This is advantage of run time polymorphism.

//example1 uses base obj as parameter, example2 uses base ref as param, so it allows runtime polymorphism

//***example1 and example2 are created just to show how compile and runtime polymorphism works.***
